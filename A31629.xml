            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL For Erecting a GENERAL BANK: Which may be fitly called the LAND BANK of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>It is humbly Propoſed;</opener>
            <p n="1">1. THAT a perpetual Land Tax, of ſixpence yearly in the pound, be granted by Parliament: or that ſuch a Tax or Rent Charge be laid upon Land. Which amounting to upwards of two hundred thouſand Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> will be a good Fund or Credit for this new Bank.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the general Directors of this Bank (between twenty and thirty, or what other number is thought fit) be named and appointed by Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this Bank be managed for the benefit and behoof of thoſe that ſupport it, that is, the Landholders that pay the Tax. Who are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it back (and the Overplus likewiſe, which may be five times more than the Tax) in the ſame proportions they paid it. And the ſame Officers that collected and received the Tax, may receive back and diſtribute the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus; with the ſame Allowances for their pains.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>London</hi> may not wholly engroſs this Bank: but that ſome part of it be ſhared out to ſix other Places. Namely, <hi>Exeter, Briſtol, Shrewsbury</hi> or <hi>Ludlow, York, Newark,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Norwich</hi> or <hi>Thetford</hi> or St. <hi>Edmunds-Bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That each of theſe particular Banks may have, for its Support and Fund, the Tax of the adjoyning Counties: that is to ſay; That the Bank of <hi>Exeter</hi> may have <hi>Cornwal, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet. Briſtol</hi> may have <hi>Somerſet, Wilts, Glouceſter, Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan. Shrewsbury</hi> (or <hi>Ludlow</hi>) may have <hi>Cheſhire, Shropſhire, Stafford, Worceſter, Hereford,</hi> and all <hi>Wales</hi> except <hi>Glamorgan</hi> and <hi>Monmouth. York</hi> may have the whole Northern Circuit, or the ſix Northern Counties. <hi>Newark</hi> may have the Counties of <hi>Derby, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Lincoln, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter. Norwich</hi> (or <hi>Thetford</hi> or <hi>Bury</hi>) may have <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge Shire.</hi> And all the reſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may belong to the particular Bank of <hi>London.</hi> By which Apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>London</hi> will have near four parts in ten of the Tax, and each of the other Places will have about one part in ten. So that if the whole Tax be two hundred thouſand Pounds a year; <hi>London</hi> will have about fourſcore thouſand, and each of the reſt about twenty thouſand. None of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eighteen, nor much above two and twenty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That in the general Courts of theſe Banks, every County within the reſpective Limits may have a Vote, for every hundred Pound a year which they are charged with in the Tax; the perſons Voting being choſen or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31502:2"/>by the Juſtices of each County: And that theſe Perſons may Vote by Proxy. Alſo that theſe general Courts may Elect the Directors of their reſpective Banks, from time to time.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That theſe Banks may give out their Bills, for any Summs not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the value of the Tax, which is their Stock or Fund: the Parliament declaring, at how many years purchaſe the ſaid Tax ſhall be reckoned. If it be reckon'd at twenty years purchaſe, (as it well may be, the whole Diſtrict, or all the Counties within that Bank, being bound to make it good); a Tax of two hundred thouſand pound a year will be a Credit for four Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. That moreover, upon ſpecial Occaſions and with the Licenſe of the Directors General, the Particular Banks may engage a little beyond their Fund: but even theſe Directors ſhould have Limits given them, which they muſt not exceed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Directors of particular Banks, beſide their competent Salaries, may have a ſhare (ſuppoſe a tenth part) of the Overplus or clear Profit they make; to encourage their Induſtry and Ingenuity. But the Directors General, ſhould not be concern'd in the Profit or Loſs. It being Their Buſineſs to mind the general Good of the Kingdom, and to ſee things fairly carried. For which End the particular Banks ſhould be under their Controll and Inſpection.</p>
            <p>If this way be taken, there will be no need of the Duty upon Salt, to make a Fund of. Why ſhould we be making more Funds, when the beſt Fund of all other (that is, the Land of <hi>England</hi>) lies ready? That Duty therefore will be a good Credit for an ordinary Loan. And it may be preſumed, that the preſent Bank of <hi>England</hi> will advance a far greater Summ upon it, than can be had by making it the Fund of a New Bank.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that in the way propoſed there will be great trouble in paying and repaying; that is, the Landholders paying the Tax to the Banks, and the Banks repaying to the Landholders their Shares or Dividends; the Anſwer is this. That when the Profits of the Banks come to be greater than the Tax, which they will quickly be, the payment of the Tax will ceaſe: and the Landholders will have nothing to do, as to this matter, ſave only to receive their Dividends. The Tax the while giving Countenance and Credit to the Banks, by being ready when it ſhall be demanded.</p>
            <p>Theſe Banks will mightily advance the Trade and Riches of the Places where they are fix'd, both Towns and Countries. And Parliaments, as they have occaſion for Money, may enlarge the Credit of theſe Banks, and may make uſe of them and command them as they pleaſe, to the very great Eaſe and Benefit of the Publick.</p>
            <p>As for the Bank now in being, which hath been eſtabliſht by the Invitation, Encouragement, and Authority of Parliament: it may be ſafely preſumed, that no Parliament will go about to deſtroy it, or do it prejudice, either directly or indirectly: and that honourable Satisfaction will be made them by Parliament. For it muſt be confeſs'd, that the erecting thoſe New Banks will be a plain prejudice to the Bank now in being: but Prejudice with Satisfaction is in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no Prejudice. This Satisfaction or Recompence may be given without much difficulty: and then let thoſe Land Banks and this Money Bank do their beſt.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected, that in a Buſineſs of this nature the Reſolutions ſhould be ſuddain. For tho the thing propoſed be feaſible and eaſy, and tho the Advantages of it may be infinite; yet being of ſo great Concernment to the whole Kingdom, it requires great Deliberation and Conſultation. Nor doth there in truth, at preſent, ſeem any Occaſion of Haſte, for ſetting up New Banks.</p>
